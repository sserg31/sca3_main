      Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Thunar has been designed from the ground up to
      be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless
      options by default. Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and folder load time.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Thunar file manager thereby provides an integrated access point to your files and applications. You can use the
      file manager to do the following:

  <sect1 id="the-file-manager-window">
    <title>The File Manager Window</title>

    <para>
      By default the file manager window consists of a shortcut pane on the left side, the main area on the right
      and a pathbar above the main area.
    </para>

    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>

          <phrase>File Manager Window</phrase>
        </textobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>

    <para>
      The <guilabel>Shortcut Pane</guilabel> provides shortcuts to different folders on your system. The first
      shortcut will lead to your <emphasis>Home Folder</emphasis>, the folder you store all your personal data,
      and will therefore have the name of the current user. The second shortcut will take you to the trash bin,
      which stores deleted files that can be recovered later. The third shortcut takes you to the <emphasis>Desktop
      Folder</emphasis>, which contains the files and folders that are displayed on the desktop. The fourth
      shortcut will take you to the root of your file system - you may want to explore it a bit, even though
      it may be confusing to you if you are new to Linux/Unix. Just click on the different folders and see what is
      inside.
    </para>

    <para>
      Below the <emphasis>File System</emphasis> shortcut, the removable drives and media will be displayed. In
      the screenshot above, you can see a <guilabel>Floppy Drive</guilabel> shortcut. Click on these shortcuts
      to access the data stored on the removable drives and media. See <xref linkend="using-removable-media" />
      for further details.
    </para>

    <para>
      The remaining shortcuts are user defined. Add your own shortcuts by simply dragging folders to the
      <guilabel>Shortcuts Pane</guilabel>. This will allow you to access important folders instantly. To
      remove a previously added shortcut, right-click on the shortcut and choose <guimenuitem>Remove Shortcut</guimenuitem>.
      To rename a previously added shortcut, right-click on the shortcut and choose <guimenuitem>Rename Shortcut</guimenuitem>.
      Note that these actions affect only the shortcut, not the folder referenced by the shortcuts.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <emphasis>main area</emphasis> will always display the contents of the current folder. Double click on
      folders to enter them, and right-click on files or folders to get a context-menu offering some choices of
      what to do with it. Select multiple files by dragging a rectangle over them with the mouse. Alternatively,
      select one file, hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key, and increase or decrease the selection using
      the arrow keys.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <emphasis>pathbar</emphasis> will always show the path you took to get to the folder you are currently
      at. You can click on any pathbar button to change to the folder it represents. Right-click on a pathbar
      button to bring up a context-menu with some options.
    </para>

      <title>Customizing the Appearance</title>

        <para>
          If you prefer to display the contents of the folder as a list, using the <guilabel>Detailed List View</guilabel>, you can

    <sect2 id="opening-files">
      <title>Opening Files</title>

      <para>
        When you open a file, the file manager performs the default action for that file type. For example, opening a text file
        will display it in the default text editor, while opening an image file will display the image in the default image
        viewer.
      </para>

      <para>
        The file manager checks the extension of a file to determine the type of a file. If the file has no known extension, the
        file manager examines the contents of the file.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="executing-the-default-action">
        <title>Executing the Default Action</title>

        <para>
          To execute the default for a file, double-click on the file. For example, the default action for audio files is to
          play the it with the default music playing application. In this case, you can double-click on the file to open the
          file in the music player.
        </para>

        <para>
          You can set <application>Thunar</application> preferences so that you click once on a file to execute the default
          action. For information, see <xref linkend="preferences-behavior" />.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="executing-non-default-actions">
        <title>Executing Non-Default Actions</title>

        <para>
          To execute actions other than the default action for a file, select the file that you want to perform an action on.
          Choose the desired action from the <emphasis>Open With</emphasis> choices available in <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu
          or an <guimenu>Open With</guimenu> submenu.

          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>
          The action you have chosen is now added to the list of actions for that particular file type. If you enabled the
          <guibutton>Use as default for this kind of file</guibutton> option or there was no prior action associated with the
          type, the newly added action is the default.
        </para>

        <para>
          You may also add actions using the <guibutton>Open With</guibutton> button under

      <title>Accessing Removable Media</title>

      <para>
        Thunar supports removable media if it was built with support for <ulink type="http" url="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal">HAL</ulink>,
        or if you are using <ulink type="http" url="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</ulink>. Note however that on FreeBSD 6.0 or newer, it is
        suggested to use HAL rather than the native support provided by Thunar.

      <sect3 id="to-mount-media">
        <title>To Mount Media</title>

        <para>
          To <emphasis>mount</emphasis> media is to make the file system of the media available for access. When you mount media, the
          file system of the media is attached as a subdirectory to your file system.
        </para>

        <para>
          To access media, insert the media in the appropriate device, or connect the new device to your computer (i.e. connect an USB
          stick to one of your USB ports). An object that represents the media is added to the side pane of the file manager. If
          <application>xfdesktop</application> is running and configured to display <guilabel>File/launcher icons</guilabel> this
          object will also be added to your desktop.
        </para>

        <para>
          To actually mount the media, click on the object that represents the media. For example, to mount a floppy diskette,
          click on the <guilabel>Floppy Drive</guilabel> object in the side pane. The file manager will now add the file system
          of the media to your file system hierarchy and display the contents of the floppy diskette in the main area.

        <title>To Eject Media</title>

        <para>
          If the drive for the media is a motorized drive (i.e. a CD-ROM drive), right-click on the media object in the side pane
          or on the desktop and choose <guilabel>Eject Volume</guilabel>. The media is ejected from the drive after a few seconds.
          If the drive for the media is not motorized (i.e. a floppy drive or an USB stick), right-click on the media object and
          choose <guilabel>Unmount Volume</guilabel>. After a short period of time, a notification will appear to inform you
          that it is now safe to remove the media or disconnect the drive from the computer.

        <para>
          However this notification will only be displayed if support for <application>libnotify</application> is enabled,
          and you have installed a notification daemon. A notification daemon for Xfce is available from the <ulink type="http"
          url="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/notification-daemon-xfce">Xfce Goodies Project</ulink>.
          If notification support is not available, wait until the context menu disappears before you remove the media or disconnect
          the drive.
        </para>

        <para>
          Be aware that you cannot eject or unmount media that is still in use by one or more applications. Therefore if the file
          manager refuses to eject media, make sure you close all applications that were accessing the media, and be sure to also
          check command line applications running in <application>Terminal</application> windows.
        </para>

        <para>
          Make sure to unmount removable media before ejecting. Do not eject a diskette from the floppy drive before your unmount
          the diskette. Do not remove an USB stick before you unmount the flash drive. If you do not unmount the media first you
          might lose data or cause your system to crash.

        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Send To</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the main menu, or right-click
        on a file or folder and choose <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Send To</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.

        By default, the <guilabel>Send To</guilabel> menu includes an entry named <guilabel>Desktop (Create Link)</guilabel> for all
        files and folders, which simply creates a link on the desktop for each selected file. In addition, if the <guilabel>Shortcuts
        Pane</guilabel> is active, the menu also includes an entry called <guilabel>Side Pane (Create Shortcut)</guilabel> for folders,
        which allows users to add new shortcuts to the side pane. Following these entries, <application>Thunar</application> lists
        the removable drives currently plugged into the computer. In the screenshot above, the <guilabel>Floppy Drive</guilabel>
        represents a possible target where files can be sent to. Note that the device is mounted automatically once selected from
        the <guilabel>Send To</guilabel> menu, so you do not need to manually mount it.
      </para>

      <para>
        In addition <application>Thunar</application> also ships the <application>thunar-sendto-email</application> plugin, which adds
        the entry <guilabel>Mail Recipient</guilabel> to the menu, that opens the mail composer with the selected files attach to the
        new email. If the selection contains atleast one folder, the selected items are added to a ZIP archive before attaching them
        to the email. Otherwise, if the selection contains multiple files, or a single file, which is larger than 200Kib, the user will
        be prompted whether to pack the files into a ZIP archive, and send the ZIP archive.
      </para>

      <para>
        Like most other features of <application>Thunar</application>, the <guilabel>Send to</guilabel> menu can be easily extended
        by users and application developers with new targets, using standard <ulink type="http"
        url="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fdesktop_2dentry_2dspec">desktop entry files</ulink>. These files must be
        installed into one of the <filename role="directory">$XDG_DATA_DIRS/Thunar/sendto/</filename> folders (see the <ulink type="http"
        url="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fbasedir_2dspec">XDG Base Directory Specification</ulink> for details about the
        <literal>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</literal> variable).
      </para>

      <para>
        The <literal>MimeType</literal> of the target <filename>.desktop</filename> specifies the types of files for which this action
        should be available in the <guilabel>Send To</guilabel> menu. For example, say you want to add entry for a <ulink type="http"
        url="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</ulink> uploader tool, then this entry should only show up if the selection contains JPEG
        files (other file formats are not supported by Flickr) and so you should add a line <literal>MimeType=image/jpeg;</literal>.
        If you do not specify any <literal>MimeType</literal> your entry will show up for all file types.
      </para>

      <para>
        A complete example using the <application>postr</application> application is shown below:

      <title>Thumbnailers</title>

      <para>
        Thunar uses small utilities to create thumbnails of certain file types and displays the thumbnails as preview of the
        file content. These small tools are called thumbnailers. Thunar ships with thumbnailers for image and font files, and
        makes use of the installed thumbnailers from GNOME automatically if it was installed with support for <literal>gconf</literal>.
        Users may however dynamically extend this basic functionality with thumbnailers for additional file types.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you plan to write a custom thumbnailers, you need to start with a program that accepts atleast two command line parameters,
        the input file, which is of the file type you plan to support and the output file, which is a PNG file that complies with the
        format specified by the <ulink type="http" url="http://jens.triq.net/thumbnail-spec/creation.html#AEN139">Thumbnail Management
        Standard</ulink>. Additionally your program may also accept the desired size of the thumbnail, which is optional but highly
        recommended. If you write the output file at an arbitrary image size, Thunar will afterwards scale it to the desired size,
        which might produce a less optimal result than generating the thumbnail with the requested dimensions.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once your utility to generate the thumbnails is done, you will need to register your thumbnailer, so Thunar is able to locate
        and use it. Therefore all you need to do is to install a description file for the thumbnailer (a <filename>.desktop</filename> file)
        in one of the <filename role="directory">$XDG_DATA_DIRS/thumbnailers/</filename> paths. For example, if you want to register the
        thumbnailer for your user account only, you can install the file into the folder <filename
        role="directory">~/.local/share/thumbnailers/</filename>. The <filename>.desktop</filename> for thumbnailers has the following format.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="thumbnailer-desktop-file-format">

        <para>
          The <literal>X-Thumbnailer-Exec</literal> field contains the command to run your thumbnailer, and supports certain field codes that will

        <title>Example EPS Thumbnailer</title>

        <para>
          This example demonstrates how to write and install a new thumbnailer for <filename>.eps</filename> files, which uses the
          <command>convert</command> utility that ships as part of ImageMagick. First, we start with a simple script that invokes
          <command>convert</command> to generate a thumbnail at the requested size.
        </para>

        <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
#
# eps-thumbnailer - Example thumbnailer script for EPS files.
#
# Usage: esp-thumbnailer eps-file png-file size
#

# command line parameters
ifile=$1
ofile=$2
size=$3

# invoke convert (ImageMagick)
exec convert "eps:$ifile" -scale "$sizex$size" "png:$ofile"</programlisting>

        <para>
          Save this script above to a file <filename>eps-thumbnailer</filename>, make sure the file is executable and install it
          to <filename role="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename>.
        </para>

        <screen>
$ chmod +x eps-thumbnailer
$ sudo install eps-thumbnailer /usr/local/bin/eps-thumbnailer</screen>

        <para>
          Next we need to create the thumbnail description file <filename>eps-thumbnailer.desktop</filename>, which looks like this:
        </para>

        <programlisting>
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Type=X-Thumbnailer
Name=EPS Thumbnailer
TryExec=convert
MimeType=image/x-eps;
X-Thumbnailer-Exec=/usr/local/bin/eps-thumbnailer %i %o %s</programlisting>

        <para>
          This file must be installed to <filename role="directory">/usr/local/share/thumbnailers</filename> (create the folder if
          it does not exists).
        </para>

        <screen>
$ sudo install -d /usr/local/share/thumbnailers
$ sudo install eps-thumbnailer.desktop /usr/local/share/thumbnailers/eps-thumbnailer.desktop</screen>

        <para>
          The <filename>eps-thumbnailer.desktop</filename> file uses the special key <literal>TryExec</literal>, which, if specified,
          names a command that must be present on the system for the thumbnailer to be useful. In this case, our script is useless if
          the <command>convert</command> utility is not present.
        </para>

        <para>
          The last step is to regenerate the thumbnailer cache, so Thunar will pick up our thumbnailer. The thumbnailer cache is located
          at <filename>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Thunar/thumbnailers.cache</filename> (unless overridden by your or your system administrator, the
          <varname>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</varname> points to the folder <filename role="directory">~/.cache/</filename>). The thumbnailers
          cache is regenerated periodically by Thunar, but you can force to regenerate it by invoking the
          <filename>thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache-1</filename> utility, that ships as part of Thunar. This utility is usually installed
          in the <filename role="directory">libexec</filename> subfolder of your installation prefix (<filename role="directory">sbin</filename>
          on Debian/Ubuntu). So for example, if Thunar is installed in <filename role="directory">/usr</filename>, invoke the utility as
          follows:
        </para>

        <screen>$ /usr/libexec/thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache-1</screen>

        <para>
          But make sure you run the program from your user account, not the superuser account, since the thumbnailers cache is stored in
          your home folder, rather than a system wide location.
        </para>

        <para>
          Now, if Thunar is compiled with support for file alteration monitoring (using the FAM or Gamin services), it will automatically
          pick up the new thumbnailers cache within a few seconds and afterwards be able to generate thumbnails using your custom
          thumbnailers. Otherwise you might need to completely restart Thunar to apply the changes, using
        </para>

        <screen>$ Thunar -q</screen>

        <para>
          to terminate any running instance, and afterwards restart it from your launcher.

    <sect2 id="the-unix-file-system">
      <title>The UNIX File System</title>

      <para>
        While the Thunar file manager does a good job at abstracting the details of the underlying file system, so the user
        does not need to care about them, it is sometimes useful to understand the basic concepts to get the whole picture.
        This section tries to give a brief introduction to the concepts of the UNIX file system, which is used today by all
        incarnations of UNIX, including Linux.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="folders-and-paths">
        <title>Folders and Paths</title>

        <para>
          In a UNIX file system all folders are arranged in a simple inverted tree structure descending and branching down
          from a single top level folder, which is called the <emphasis>root directory</emphasis> (the term
          <emphasis>directory</emphasis> is often used instead of <emphasis>folder</emphasis>) and displayed as
          <guilabel>File System</guilabel> in Thunar. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going
          up the tree until you reach a common point, then down the tree through the appropriate subfolders until you reach
          your target.
        </para>

        <para>
          The position of any file or folder in the tree can be described by its <emphasis>path</emphasis>. The path is the
          list of folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file, starting from the top level
          folder. For example <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> is the subfolder <filename
          role="directory">luke</filename> of the subfolder <filename role="directory">home</filename> of the top level folder,
          and <filename>/home/luke/myfile.txt</filename> is the file <filename>myfile.txt</filename> in that subfolder. The
          leading <filename role="directory">/</filename> in these paths represents the top level folder.
        </para>

        <para>
          Every user has their own folder to hold their personal files and settings. This folder is called the <emphasis>home
          directory</emphasis> and is displayed in Thunar as special icon with the users login name. The folder is similar to
          the <guilabel>My Files</guilabel> folder known from Windows. The <emphasis>home directories</emphasis> of the various
          users in a system are usually located below the <filename role="directory">/home</filename> folder. For example
          <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> would be the home directory of the user with the login name
          <filename role="directory">luke</filename>, while <filename role="directory">/home/jane</filename> would be
          the home directory for the user with the login name <filename role="directory">jane</filename>.

          You may have already heard that everything is a file in UNIX. This is true for most objects present in UNIX systems
          today. In fact even devices are represented as a special files. While this may not make sense at first sight, it is
          one of the strengths of UNIX and its derivates, and has helped it to maintain a simple core over the years where other
          operating systems had to introduce new concepts for every new technology.

    <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

    <para>
      The intent of this section is to collect the quite numerous frequently asked
      questions that relate to working with Thunar. If you know of a question that
      is missing from this page, please <ulink type="http"
      url="http://bugzilla.xfce.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Thunar&amp;format=guided">file
      a request</ulink>.
    </para>

    <sect3 id="faq-executables">
      <title>Why doesn't Thunar execute files marked as executable?</title>

      <para>
        For security reasons Thunar only executes files of type <literal>application/x-desktop</literal>,
        <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>. For
        desktop files the execution feature will only be enabled if the desktop file is of type
        <literal>Application</literal> and a valid <literal>Exec</literal> line is given or of type
        <literal>Link</literal> and a valid <literal>URL</literal> is given. For the other types the feature
        is available if the file is marked executable for the current user.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also note that for <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>,
        the types of the file don't really need to match these types exactly, but it is suffice if the detected
        type has a parent that matches one of the two types listed above, or if the MIME-type is an alias for
        one of the above.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-metadata">
      <title>Where does Thunar store the metadata associated with files?</title>

      <para>
        Thunar associates various settings with files/folders, which we call metadata.
        This metadata for all files is stored in tdb database file, which is called
        the metafile. The database file is stored in
        <filename>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Thunar/metafile.tdb</filename> and can be examined
        using the <command>tdbtool</command>, which is part of the Thunar distribution
        (located in the <filename role="directory">tdb/</filename> subdirectory).
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-thunarrc">
      <title>Where does Thunar store its preferences?</title>

      <para>
        Thunar stores the user configurable preferences (and hidden settings) in
        an <filename>.ini</filename> file, which is located at
        <filename>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Thunar/thunarrc</filename> and can be examined
        using a text editor. See <filename>docs/README.thunarrc</filename> for an
        overview of the various preferences.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-mouse-gestures">
      <title>How to use mouse gestures in Thunar?</title>

      <para>
        Thunar currently features basic support for so called <emphasis>mouse gestures</emphasis>
        in its icon view. You can use these <emphasis>mouse gestures</emphasis> by holding down
        the middle mouse button (usually the mouse wheel) while the mouse pointer is on the
        background area of the icon view component (any area that is not covered by
        an icon or a text). Now you can move the cursor into four directions to
        perform certain actions, which are described below.
      </para>

      <simplelist>
        <member><guilabel>Left</guilabel> - opens the previous visited folder</member>
        <member><guilabel>Up</guilabel> - opens the parent folder</member>
        <member><guilabel>Right</guilabel> - opens the next visited folder</member>
        <member><guilabel>Down</guilabel> - reloads the current folder</member>
      </simplelist>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-assign-keyboard-shortcuts">
      <title>How do I assign different keyboard shortcuts?</title>

      <para>
        If you want to rebind a shortcut, Thunar supports the standard GTK+ way
        of changing shortcuts: simply hover over the menu option with the mouse
        pointer and press the keyboard shortcut you want to rebind it to.
      </para>

      <para>
        To delete a keyboard assignment, press the <keycap>Backspace</keycap> key
        while you are on the menu entry.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the shortcut doesn't change, then you need to enable the feature in
        GTK+. This can be achieved in 3 ways:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            If you are running Xfce 4.3 or above then you can enable <guilabel>Editable
            menu accelerators</guilabel> in the <guilabel>User Interface Preferences</guilabel>
            dialog.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            If you are running GNOME then you can enable <guilabel>Editable menu
            accelerators</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Menu and Toolbars</guilabel> control
            center dialog.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Otherwise put the following in your <filename>~/.gtkrc-2.0</filename> file
            (create the file if it doesn't exist):<screen>gtk-can-change-accels=1</screen>
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-store-keyboard-shortcuts">
      <title>Where does Thunar store the keyboard shortcuts?</title>

      <para>
        The custom keyboard shortcuts are stored in the standard GTK+ accel map format in a
        file located at <filename>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Thunar/accels.scm</filename>. Lines starting
        with <literal>;</literal> are comments. See the GTK+ documentation for details about the
        file format.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you are a packager or a system administrator and want to provide a system wide default
        for the keyboard shortcuts, that is different from the default shortcuts in Thunar, you
        can create a file <filename>Thunar/accels.scm</filename> in one of the <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar>.
        For example, if <filename role="directory">/etc/xdg</filename> is part of <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar>
        (the default for most Linux distributions), you can install system wide defaults to
        <filename>/etc/xdg/Thunar/accels.scm</filename>. Thunar will then load shortcuts from this file on first startup.

      Remember that useful bug reports are ones that get bugs fixed, so a useful bug report has two qualities:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Reproducible.</emphasis> If the developer cannot see the bug himself
          to prove that it exists, he will most probably not be able to fix it at all. Every detail you
          can provide helps.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Specific.</emphasis> The quicker the developer can isolate the problem
          to a specific area, the more likely he will expediently fix it.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      In case you want to request a new feature, please make clear why you consider it a worth
      addition for the application. It is more likely that a new feature gets added if you provide
      good arguments for the feature. It will increase the chance of addition even more if you
      provide a patch that implements the requested feature, but make sure that you read the file
      <ulink type="http" url="http://svn.xfce.org/svn/xfce/terminal/trunk/HACKING">HACKING</ulink>
      - especially the section labeled <emphasis>Coding Style</emphasis> - before you start hacking
      up the source.
