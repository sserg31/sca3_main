        To <span class="emphasis"><em>bulk rename</em></span> files means to rename multiple files at once using some criterion, that applies to atleast
        one of the files. <strong class="application"><code>Thunar</code></strong> includes a bulk renamer, which can be run separately using the command
        <span><strong class="command">Thunar -B</strong></span> or from within <strong class="application"><code>Thunar</code></strong> by selecting two or more files in the main area
        and pressing <span><strong class="keycap">F2</strong></span> or choosing
        <span><strong class="guimenu">Edit</strong></span> &#8594; <span><strong class="guimenuitem">Rename...</strong></span> from the main menu.
      </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/bulk-rename.png" alt="Bulk Rename Files"></div></div><p>
        The <span class="emphasis"><em>Bulk Renamers</em></span> can be applied to the name of the files, the suffix of the files or both to the
        name and the suffix of the files. <strong class="application"><code>Thunar</code></strong> currently supports the following <span class="emphasis"><em>Bulk
        Renamers</em></span>:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Remove characters.</p></li><li><p>Numbering files.</p></li><li><p>Insert Date or Time.</p></li><li><p>Insert or overwrite characters.</p></li><li><p>Search and replace characters.</p></li><li><p>Convert to uppercase, lowercase or camlcase.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        Additional <span class="emphasis"><em>Bulk Renamers</em></span> may be installed as plugins for <strong class="application"><code>Thunar</code></strong>. Check
        the <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/plugins.html" target="_top">Thunar Plugins</a> website for currently available
        extensions. The <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/pwiki/documentation/bulk_renamer" target="_top">Thunar Project Wiki</a>
        contains further details about this feature. Feel free to add more information to the Wiki.

        While the Thunar file manager does a good job at abstracting the details of the underlying file system, so the user
        does not need to care about them, it is sometimes useful to understand the basic concepts to get the whole picture.
        This section tries to give a brief introduction to the concepts of the UNIX file system, which is used today by all
        incarnations of UNIX, including Linux.
      </p><div class="sect3" lang="nl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="folders-and-paths"></a>Folders and Paths</h4></div></div></div><p>
          In a UNIX file system all folders are arranged in a simple inverted tree structure descending and branching down
          from a single top level folder, which is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>root directory</em></span> (the term
          <span class="emphasis"><em>directory</em></span> is often used instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>folder</em></span>) and displayed as
          <span><strong class="guilabel">File System</strong></span> in Thunar. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going
          up the tree until you reach a common point, then down the tree through the appropriate subfolders until you reach
          your target.
        </p><p>
          The position of any file or folder in the tree can be described by its <span class="emphasis"><em>path</em></span>. The path is the
          list of folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file, starting from the top level
          folder. For example <code class="filename">/home/luke</code> is the subfolder <code class="filename">luke</code> of the subfolder <code class="filename">home</code> of the top level folder,
          and <code class="filename">/home/luke/myfile.txt</code> is the file <code class="filename">myfile.txt</code> in that subfolder. The
          leading <code class="filename">/</code> in these paths represents the top level folder.
        </p><p>
          Every user has their own folder to hold their personal files and settings. This folder is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>home
          directory</em></span> and is displayed in Thunar as special icon with the users login name. The folder is similar to
          the <span><strong class="guilabel">My Files</strong></span> folder known from Windows. The <span class="emphasis"><em>home directories</em></span> of the various
          users in a system are usually located below the <code class="filename">/home</code> folder. For example
          <code class="filename">/home/luke</code> would be the home directory of the user with the login name
          <code class="filename">luke</code>, while <code class="filename">/home/jane</code> would be
          the home directory for the user with the login name <code class="filename">jane</code>.

          You may have already heard that everything is a file in UNIX. This is true for most objects present in UNIX systems
          today. In fact even devices are represented as a special files. While this may not make sense at first sight, it is
          one of the strengths of UNIX and its derivates, and has helped it to maintain a simple core over the years where other
          operating systems had to introduce new concepts for every new technology.
        </p><p>
          These are the four most important types of files in the UNIX file system.
        </p><div class="sect4" lang="nl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="file-types-ordinary-files"></a>Ordinary Files</h5></div></div></div><p>
            An ordinary file may contain text, a program or other data. This includes image files, audio files, office documents
            and video files. The term <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span> is often used to refer to an ordinary file.
          </p></div><div class="sect4" lang="nl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="file-types-folder-files"></a>Folder Files</h5></div></div></div><p>
            Folders are also files in the UNIX file system. To be exact a folder is a special file, which contains a
            mapping of file names to file references for every file contained within this folder.
          </p></div><div class="sect4" lang="nl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="file-types-symbolic-link-files"></a>Symbolic Link Files</h5></div></div></div><p>
            A Symbolic link (often called a <span class="emphasis"><em>symlink</em></span>) is a special file that contains a path to
            another file in the file system. Symbolic link files therefore do not contain any useful information
            themselves, but just refer to other files.
          </p></div><div class="sect4" lang="nl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="file-types-device-files"></a>Device Files</h5></div></div></div><p>
            As mentioned earlier (most) devices are also accessed through the file system. These special device files are
            usually located in the <code class="filename">/dev</code> folder. For example the special file
            <code class="filename">/dev/hda</code> represents the first IDE disk on Linux.
