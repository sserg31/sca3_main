xfce4 (4.3.90.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is the 4.4beta1 release of xfce.  If you are running xfce at the time
  you do this upgrade please consider restarting very shortly afterwards.

  This is a major upgrade and as such you will lose some of your config - there
  is no sane way for us to avoid this.  Notably the panel config will need to
  be changed.  Also as this is a beta please consider reporting any bugs to
  upstream first or to both the BTS and upstream's bugzilla at
  http://bugzilla.xfce.org/

  Also #xfce and #debian-xfce on irc.freenode.net can be useful resources.
