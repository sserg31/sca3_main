Managing shutdown
-----------------

There are three ways to enable user to shutdown the computer from Xfce:

 - use sudo, and allow user to run /usr/sbin/xfsm-shutdown-helper in sudoers
 - use dbus and hal
   - hal and dbus should be installed, up and running
   - user should be in powerdev group
 - use policykit and a compatible login manager (gdm is known to work)
