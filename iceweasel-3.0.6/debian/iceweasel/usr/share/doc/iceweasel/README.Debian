Iceweasel for Debian
====================

Please read the file /usr/share/bug/iceweasel/presubj for information
you may want to know if you will report a bug.

Why is it not called Firefox?
-----------------------------

Due to our inability to use the Firefox logo because of a non-free
copyright, the Mozilla Corporation insisted that we not use the
trademarked name Firefox either. Most of the details are documented in
#354622 <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354622>. 

Even though it is not called Firefox, it still comes from exactly the
same upstream, and is by and large exactly the same (the differences
some distribution specific customizations, rebranding and the
occasional bug fix).

Application Update
------------------

From version 1.5beta1 onwards, the automatic application update has been
disabled through the app.update.enabled preference, which is locked to
'false' by /usr/lib/iceweasel/greprefs/iceweasel.cfg.

Automatic extensions update, which used to be disabled; has been re-enabled,
since the Extensions Manager has a correct behaviour with system-wide
installed extensions now.

Extensions
----------

From Firefox 0.9, "old" extensions are disabled at first run (i.e.
when no profile was found). By old extensions, Firefox means extensions
not following the new extensions guidelines described at:
http://www.bengoodger.com/software/mb/extensions/packaging/extensions.html
But even the ones following these guidelines can be considered old if the
contents.rdf file in their chrome gives the attribute chrome:extension = 
"true" in the package information.

Some extensions can also get disabled by a new release of Iceweasel, because
the install.rdf file provided by the extension says it's targetted for a
maximum version older than the current one.

Packaged Extensions
-------------------

With older versions of Firefox, an update-mozilla-firefox-chrome script was
provided so that extensions are correctly enabled in Firefox. This has been
obsoleted by the new Extensions Manager, and the update-mozilla-firefox-chrome
script removed. Packages that use this script to support older versions of
Firefox are advised to check for its presence before using it.

Sound
-----

By default, iceweasel detects and runs the correct dsp wrapper for esd,
arts, or alsa. If this is not the desired behaviour, edit
/etc/iceweasel/iceweaselrc or ~/.mozilla/firefox/rc and set the ICEWEASEL_DSP
variable to:

"auto": Auto-detection.

"esddsp": Use esd.

"artsdsp": Use arts.

"aoss": Use alsa.

"none": The default, don't use any sound wrapper.


using Java. (You should use plugin which compiled with gcc-3.2 or newer)
----------
 
You can install one of the following packages: 
 - gcjwebplugin,
 - java-gcj-compat-plugin,
 - sun-java5-plugin.

Alternatively, you can grab a binary Java distribution from
http://java.sun.com/, install the java-package package and do a make-jpkg
on the file.

Buttons
-------

Some people have complained that the button order in dialogs is
non-intuitive (ie, they don't like it). To reverse the order, add the
following to your chrome/userChrome.css file, under the
~/.mozilla/firefox directory:

.dialog-button-box { -moz-box-direction: reverse; -moz-box-pack: right; }
.dialog-button-box spacer { display: none ! important; }

Emacs keybindings
-----------------

Versions of Firefox before 1.0 supported Emacs style keybindings in
text entry boxes. Version 1.0 now merely follows the GTK keybindings
settings. To enable Emacs keybindings in GTK, follow the instructions
at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Emacs_Keybindings_(Firefox).

Pango
-----

From version 3.0~b4-1, pango is the only font backend upstream.
MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO now has no effect.

Well Known Ports
----------------

To prevent Iceweasel from being used to launch attacks against other
protocols, certain ports cannot be connected to by default. See
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html for further
information. To allow the port numbers being used, enter
"about:config" in the URL bar and edit the
"network.security.ports.banned.override" entry to list the ports you
wish to allow (eg "2049,4045,6000").
