  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/control:
    - Replace a bunch of build dependencies with xulrunner-dev and
      xulrunner-1.9-common (a versioned dependency is required for this one
      because of an incompatible platform.ini in 1.9~b5-1).
    - iceweasel now depends on xulrunner-1.9 (we rely on xulrunner-stub from
      version 1.9~b5-4).
    - iceweasel-dbg depends on xulrunner-1.9-dbg.
    - iceweasel-gnome-support is transformed into a dummy package to install
      xulrunner-1.9-gnome-support.
  * debian/iceweasel-gnome-support.*: Removed.

      firefox binary, which is a copy of xulrunner-stub.
    - defaults/pref is now defaults/preferences.
    - Install application.ini in /usr/lib/iceweasel instead of
      /usr/share/iceweasel. Xulrunner following symlinks, it fails running
      iceweasel without the file being in /usr/lib/iceweasel.
  * debian/rules:
    - Build against xulrunner-1.9.
    - Don't install files in the iceweasel-gnome-support package and don't
      filter anything in the iceweasel package.
    - Don't set general.useragent.product and general.useragent.productSub,
      they have no effect anymore.
    - defaults/pref is now defaults/preferences.
    - Remove specific CFLAGS for alpha and ppc64, since we don't build from
      code that may require it.
    - Properly cleanup debian/branding with clean rule.
  * debian/iceweasel.links:
    - Install the xulrunner-stub as a /usr/lib/iceweasel/firefox-bin symlink.
      It will also allow smooth upgrade for those whose session manager stored
      firefox-bin as iceweasel main executable.
    - Help xulrunner-stub by pointing to xulrunner's home with a
      /usr/lib/iceweasel/xulrunner symlink to /usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.
  * debian/iceweasel.postinst: Remove /usr/lib/iceweasel/.autoreg on upgrade.

  * Urgency still high, as we're still trying to get into testing.
  * debian/firefox.desktop: Patch from Nick Niktaris with Greek
    translation. (Closes: #384678)
  * debian/control: Add Suggests on mozplugger. (Closes: #384382)

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/control: Adjust dependencies for binNMU safety.
  * xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/Makefile.in, configure.in, configure:
    Use ${host_cpu} instead of uname -m so that firefox can safely build on
    s390x with a s390 target, and on amd64 with an x86 target.
  * uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsGNOMERegistry.cpp,
    uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsGNOMERegistry.h,
    uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsOSHelperAppService.cpp,

  * New upstream beta release.

  * extensions/inspector/build/src/Makefile.in,
    extensions/inspector/build/src/inspector.pkg,
    extensions/inspector/build/src/nsInspectorModule.cpp: Removed, the problem
    was lying in debian/rules. /me goes hiding under a rock.
  * layout/inspector/public/Makefile.in: Reverted previous changes.
  * debian/rules: Don't exclude inspector files when dh_installing the firefox
    package. We need the inspector.xpt file from the components directory. The

    firefox.install file anyway.
  * debian/firefox-dom-inspector.install,
    debian/firefox-dom-inspector.links: Simplified.
  * debian/control:
    + Turn firefox-dom-inspector into an arch: all package, since the binary
      component has been merged into the firefox binary.
    + Adjust dependencies for binNMU safety.

  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * debian/control: 
    - Fix silly typo of binutils. (Closes: #378582)
    - Standards-Version to 3.7.2.1.
  
  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Use a specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH at link time so that we don't need to
      link against indirect dependencies. (Closes: #378378)
    - Run shlibsign after the files are stripped so that it is accurate and
      FIPS mode can correctly work.
    - Removed old commented out OPTFLAGS that were kept in case gcc 4.0 did
      no better than gcc 3.x.
    - Removed old exported variables that are useless nowadays.
    - Removed dh_strip call in binary-indep. Who wants to strip
      arch-independant files ;)
  * debian/presubj: Added notes about plugins and crash reports.
  * security/manager/Makefile.in, security/nss/cmd/shlibsign/Makefile:
    Don't build nor install the .chk files but still build shlibsign.
  * debian/firefox.install: Don't install .chk files since we generate them
    after dh_strip.

  * config/rules.mk, debian/control: Apply patch from Thiemo Seufer to
    remove mips -xgot hack and build depend on the appropriate binutils on

    disabling Pango, which often seems to be the source of problems.

    - Print out MOZ_NO_REMOTE in verbose mode.
    - Fix some unreachable logic, Thanks Daniel Jacobowitz.

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Fix for Gecko date extraction from client.mk.
    - Disabled strict aliasing from optimized builds.
    - Added -Wl,--as-needed to the LDFLAGS, so that we don't get indirect
      libraries linked.
  * config/static-config.mk: Add MOZ_XFT_LIBS to STATIC_EXTRA_LIBS. It used to
    get linked as a side effect of linking to indirect libraries, but should
    be linked directly since Xft symbols are used.

    translation. ;)

    which is likely to be the closest value to the release date, instead of
    useless build date.

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Add -g to the build flags when building with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip.
      If we ask for nostrip, we want the debugging
      symbols, right? ;)
    - Changed the way we identificate ourselves in vendor.js.
  * layout/build/Makefile.in, layout/build/nsLayoutModule.cpp: Remove useless
    useragent setter at startup so that general.useragent.product and
    general.useragent.productSub set in our vendor.js preference file work at
    startup time.
  * security/coreconf/Linux.mk:

    - Don't use x86 as CPU_ARCH when building on an unsupported architecture.
  * security/manager/Makefile.in, security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/Makefile,

    debian/firefox-gnome-support.postinst, debian/firefox-gnome-support.prerm:
    Touch a .autoreg file at configure time, or removal of gnome-support and
    remove it with the package. This will trigger autoregistration of the
    components if the compreg.dat and xpti.dat files are older than the
    .autoreg file. We used to remove compatibility.ini for that reason, but
    stopped doing that because firefox was supposed to do that correctly,
    which actually only correctly works on new upstream versions, not new
    debian revisions, or installation of gnome-support.

    - Use --disable-strip, --disable-strip-libs in configure parameters.

      confuse the clean target. Thanks Ian Jackson. (Closes: #362186)

    arm. (Closes: #325535)
  * browser/app/profile/firefox.js: Revert patch to remove the "I'm
    feeling lucky" search. Some like it, some hate it, so upstream
    behaviour wins. If you still feel strongly about it, make your case
    upstream.
  * gfx/src/gtk/nsFontMetricsXft.cpp: Apply patch from bz#252033 to work

mozilla-firefox (1.0.99+deerpark-alpha2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Sync with unstable branch changes, except the controversial "I'm feeling
    lucky" change. I prefer waiting for the controversy to get to a
    conclusion.
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Remove build dependency on libmng-dev and
    the --with-system-mng option to configure, the MNG support has been
    removed upstream.
  * debian/rules: Explicitely set the svg-renderer as cairo. It will use an
    old cairo version bundled with firefox, but there's no other solution for
    the moment. We have to wait for upstream 0.9.x and greater support
    (hoped for 1.5).

    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions nor /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.install:
    - Don't install regxpchrome, chrome/pipnss.jar and chrome/help.jar which
      don't exist anymore.
    - Install manifest files in addition to jar files in chrome.
    - Install classic.jar in the normal chrome directory (awaiting EM
      modifications so that it can actually go back in the extensions
      directory).
    - Don't install debian/theme/00classic and debian/theme/Uninstall,
      which got removed.
    - Get the theme in the correct directory (it's not in
      defaults/profile/extensions anymore).
    - Install the reporter extension.
    - Selectively install subdirectories of /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults,
      since some of them are useless.
    - Install the unixprint plugin.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.manpages: Removed manual page for
    update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.links: Removed all links in
    /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/.
  * debian/rules:
    - Enable freetype in the build, we'll see if deerpark is any better than
      1.0.x.
    - Commented out OPTFLAGS set for some architectures. We will see if gcc
      4.0 is doing any better.
    - Enabled SVG support. (Closes: #215990)
    - Enabled some more extensions to fit extensions provided by upstream.
    - Added needed --enable-application=browser to the ./configure call.
    - Don't install update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
    - Don't create installed-chrome.txt.
    - Don't remove installed-extensions.txt, it doesn't exist anyway.
    - Don't move classic theme's install.rdf, it's already at the correct
      place.
    - Remove unneeded removals of preferences files which are not there
      anymore.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst: Clean-up old generated files (those in
    /var/lib/mozilla-firefox and
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/*/uninstall/Uninstall. (Note that for
    the latter, some packages do provide them, but they were overwritten by
    update-mozilla-firefox-chrome. They have actually no use, and it is safe
    to remove them. Extensions packages will eventually remove them anyway)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: Put -depth option of find before -type d.

  * debian/rules: Removed creation of the locale file in
    /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/locales.d.
  * debian/presubj: Put some more recent information.
  * htmlparser/src/nsParser.cpp: Applied patch from bz#57717 so that empty
    html files don't get <html><body></body></html> when viewing source.
  * browser/base/content/aboutDialog.css: increase the User Agent element
    height as in bz#238137 (but up to MacOSX's height) to show the full User
    Agent string.
  * xpcom/io/nsAppDirectoryServiceDefs.h,
    xpcom/io/nsAppFileLocationProvider.cpp,
    xpfe/components/search/src/nsInternetSearchService.cpp: Applied patch from
    bz#123315 so that Internet search services in user profiles are supported.
    (Closes: #219053)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner:
    + Remove compatibility.ini only if it is older than
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/components.ini. That way, we only rebuild it
      after an update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
    + Detect if we're being run through sudo without the -H option, in which
      case we force setting of $HOME. (Closes: #218156)
  * browser/app/profile/firefox.js: Sync'ed with debian/firefox.js.
  * toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in:
    + Removed some error messages that get there because firefox is trying to
      write in the /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox directory as a user. They are
      useless and lead users to think something is going wrong while it's the
      (stupid but) normal way firefox works.
    + Avoid creation of directories when attempting to read files, that
      throwed uncaught exceptions breaking some stuff in several different
      ways when extensions don't follow the new scheme for extensions.
    + Avoid copying stuff from
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/ to
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/, that's the *very* old way of
      installing extensions, which, since the old scheme has been thrown away,
      won't work anyway, if any extension provides files out there.
    + CheckForMismatches: Avoid to disable already disabled global extensions,
      and don't propose to upgrade the locked extensions. That fixes a
      never-ending loop occuring when running firefox for the first time in a
      user account, while some global extensions are expired.
      (Closes: #278722, #281537)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm, debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst: Moved
    removal of links to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/
    sitting in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/, if any remaining, from
    prerm to preinst. We remove them once and for all, they won't be created
    by us anymore.
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome:
    + Removed support for extensions in
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/.
    + Removed some clean-up that had been introduced to help the Extensions
      Manager not to die, and which, actually, did not work out quite so well.
      Anyways, with the changes this time, the EM is supposed to support much
      more problems than ever before (as usual ;) ) so we don't need that
      anymore.
    + Avoid stupid mv error messages when firefox-bin -register fails (which
      is not supposed to happen, but you're never too careful)
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome, debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst:
    Move removal of some very old stuff to preinst, to do it once and for all
    instead of doing it every time we run update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
  * netwerk/protocol/ftp/src/nsFtpConnectionThread.cpp: Applied patch from
    bz#124561 to get a prompt for username/password in case anonymous login
    fails.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner:
    + Added check for more arguments so that the url in the command line get
      detected more accurately.
    + When a file name is given on the command line, prepend "file://" and
      change spaces into %20. (Closes: #281800)

  * Changes by Eric Dorland
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: Patch from Philipp Weis to fix order of
    find arguments. (Closes: #280852)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.desktop: Support new mime type handler in Gnome
    2.8. (Closes: #281274) (MH: I added some more myme-types)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.postinst: Run update-desktop-database if it
    exists.
  * widget/src/gtk/nsWidget.cpp: We don't use gtk anymore, might as well
    revert these patches. Thanks Stephane Despret.

    file.

    - debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs: Removed creation of
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}/chrome,

    - browser/app/profile/extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}/install.rdf.in:

    - debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs: Removed creation of the directory.

      installed-chrome.txt, excluding inspector and classic theme stuff,

      /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/chrome.d related stuff.

      extensions that fail to install chrome.

    - debian/mozilla-firefox.links: Add a symlink for Extensions.rdf 
      and components.ini, from /usr to /var.
    - debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: Don't remove files we don't

      update-mozilla-firefox-chrome into the package.

  * Move preferences back into /usr:
    - debian/rules: Don't move the prefs into

      as well, and remove firefox-l10.js file.

      a hook so that defaults/syspref gets registered in defaults.ini 
      after all other extensions preferences.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst: only clean-up stuff if we are

mozilla-firefox (0.99+1.0RC1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner:
    - Fixed to run properly with dash. (Closes: #279549).
    - Fixed indentation.
    - Added a basic debugger support.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.1: Added information about debugger options.
  * debian/rules: Added a debug option to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. If you want to
    build a fully gdb'able package, use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="noopt nostrip
    debug"
  * netwerk/protocol/ftp/src/nsFtpConnectionThread.cpp: Apply new patch from
    bz#266835.
    - Further change this patch to use Append rather than AppendLiteral,
      which doesn't seem to exist. (ED)

mozilla-firefox (0.99+1.0RC1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * netwerk/protocol/ftp/src/nsFtpConnectionThread.cpp: Apply patch from
    bz#266835 to fix anonymous user password issue. (Closes: #226784)
  * toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in: (MH)
    - Fully apply previous patches, which for some reason left a spurious code
      line which made the extensions manager not like expired extensions
      anymore. (Closes: #279140)
    - Enhanced extensions manager so that the behaviour described in
      https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247846#c14 *actually*
      works. Extensions packagers are invited to move their chrome files
      accordingly, and remove /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/chrome.d files so that
      extensions chrome don't get registered when they are forced-disable due
      to version mismatch or some other reason.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner: 
    - Fix some thinkos. (MH)
    - Fix for loading files from the command line. (Closes: #279018) (MH)
    - Removed setting --display from $DISPLAY, let it get it from the 
      environment, but pass --display if it is set. (Mike, 
      I'm worried this will screw up some session 
      managers, let me know what you think, we can revert it)
    - Removed FIREFOX_OPEN_IN stuff, so that firefox now obeys to "open 
      links from other applications in" setting. (Closes: #279073) (MH)
    - Enhanced command line parsing, and drop empty arguments. 
      (Closes: #279138) (MH)
    - No need for a find to look for XUL.mfasl, we already have its 
      location from the path list taken from profiles.ini. (MH)
    - Better detection of dsp wrapper, when FIREFOX_DSP=auto. 
      (Closes: #254611) (MH)
    - Correctly open local files even when firefox was not previously 
      running. (Closes: #279018) (MH)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.1: (MH)
    - Removed references to FIREFOX_OPEN_IN.
    - Added the -safe-mode option.
  * debian/mozilla-firefoxrc: Removed FIREFOX_OPEN_IN. (MH)

mozilla-firefox (0.10.1+1.0PR-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: (MH)
    - Use upstream extensions set. This will eventually get a
      correct help menu and fix some yet undiscovered UI issues. 
      (Closes: #257946)
    - Added support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt.
    - Changed OPTFLAGS assignment.
    - Remove whitespace characters in version number for UserAgent
      branding.
    - Install mozilla-firefox-runner into /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/firefox
      (Closes: #278477)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.links: (MH)
    - Link /usr/bin/firefox and /usr/bin/mozilla-firefox to 
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/firefox.
    - Removed obsolete profile/US links.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs: Create /etc/mozilla/profile instead of
    /etc/mozilla/profile/US. (MH)
  * toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp: Fix crash in nsCmdLineService::Initialize
    when argc is changed by gtk (when treating gtk specific arguments)
    (MH)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner (Changes by MH):
    - Removed workaround for bug #122990. First, xmlterm is not an activated
      extension, and secondly, if it still requires the TERM environment
      variable, it is the user's duty to set it to whatever he wants, not
      firefox's start script's.
    - Removed the ulimit -c setting. First, it is set by default to 0 on a
      newly installed debian, and secondly, it is user's choice to set it or
      not if he needs to get core files.
    - Removed unused shell variables.
    - Removed unsetting AUDIODEV variable. If it still crashes, it does belong
      to some other code than firefox. The AUDIODEV environment variable is
      used nowhere in firefox code:
      http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/search?string=AUDIODEV
      Note that there is a "A crash which occurred when AUDIODEV doesn't
      contain "/" was fixed." log message in esound version 0.2.33 changes and
      that the bug may have belonged there.
    - Replaced ${HOME}/.mozilla-firefoxrc file by a ${HOME}/.mozilla/firefox/rc
      file. The former is still supported, though, but will bring a warning
      message. If both are present, only the latter is taken into account.
    - Changed the way system and user FIREFOX_DSP and FIREFOX_OPEN_IN
      variables are handled. First, use system values defined in
      /etc/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-firefoxrc, then override with
      ${HOME}/.mozilla/firefox/rc and then with runtime environment variables.
    - Don't die when DISPLAY is not set. Display can be passed by --display
      option, and if not set and needed (some options don't require it),
      firefox will complain.
    - Some shell code simplifications by using some coreutils.
    - Added better command line parsing.
    - Added verbosity mode.
    - Removed setting of FONTCONFIG_PATH, /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/res/Xft
      doesn't exist
    - Factorized localization detection.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.1 (MH):
    - Made some clean-up between dashes and hyphens.
    - Removed obsolete options and added new ones.
    - Added informations about some debian specific stuff.
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome: Changed the way we move files to
    /var/lib/mozilla-firefox. It will avoid creating files with a * in their
    name whenever registration failed. (MH)
  * debian/README.Debian: Update java instructions, tell them to just use
    java-package.

mozilla-firefox (0.10.1+1.0PR-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This release mostly courtesy Mike Hommey. 
  * layout/src/xul/base/src/nsImageBoxFrame.*: Backported patch from
    bz#255372. (Closes: #278046)
  * toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in: Force locking
    globally installed extensions, that will prevent extensions packages
    files to be unexpectedly removed by firefox.
  * debian/control: Add Mike Hommey as an Uploader.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.install: Removed content-packs.jar which is
    mozilla-browser specific.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs:

    - Create
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}
    /chrome directory so that preview is shown in the Themes Manager. Yes,
    this is stupid, but it is the way firefox wants it (and it's not even
    created by make install, nor in the official binary tarball. It is
    only created at run time, but you know what ? under *nix, a normal
    user can't create that directory) (Closes: #276404)

    the debian package version to the UserAgent. (Closes: #268654)

  * debian/control: 
    - Rename the mozilla-firefox-gnome-vfs package

      need for Replaces or anything, since it never actually made it to

    - Remove strict build dependencies on g++ and binutils, since the 
      fixed versions have hit sarge.
    - Remove hppa build depends, since gcc has also been fixed there.
    - Build-depend on libgnome2-dev and libgconf2-dev to build in more 
      gnome support.
    - Have mozilla-firefox recommend it's gnome support.

mozilla-firefox (0.9.3-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non Maintainer Upload for RC Fixes.
  * Applied changes to toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in
    and toolkit/mozapps/extensions/locale/extensions.properties to solve some
    issues with extensions management. (taken from CVS)
  * Applied other changes to
    toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in,
    toolkit/mozapps/extensions/public/nsIExtensionManager.idl and
    mozilla/toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp to be able to use -register
    instead of -list-global-items for extensions/components/chrome
    registration through update-mozilla-firefox-chrome, thus not needing
    Xvfb anymore (-register option doesn't require a X server).
    (taken from CVS)
  * Applied some more changes to
    toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in in order to
    avoir overlayinfo deletion during extensions registration process.
    (taken from CVS)
  * Final changes to toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in
    to avoid registering out of date extensions so that firefox doesn't enter
    a loop at startup when no profile was found, and to only write in the
    installed-extensions-processed.txt file the list of actually installed
    extensions. Note that for packaged extensions installing their files
    directly into the chrome or components directories, that only means they
    won't appear in the Extensions Manager. They will still be available in
    the GUI.
  * All these fixes improve the Extensions Manager. Closes: #259046.
  * accessible/src/atk/nsAccessibleWrap.cpp,
    accessible/src/atk/nsAccessibleWrap.h: fixed 32-bit abuse of gobject
    (Steve Langasek). Closes: #259836.
  * debian/control: Removed dependency upon xvfb.
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome:
    + Removed use of Xvfb.
    + Removed creation of a root default profile, but kept the fake home
      hack to avoid creation of a .mozilla directory in root's home.
    + Changed extensions handling so that the overall process is cleaner.
      Extensions packages will have to move extensions {uid} directories
      to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/, while the current location
      is still supported for compatibility purpose (but is strongly not
      recommended).
    + Removed use of regxpcom and regchrome, since what they both do is
      done by firefox-bin -register.
  * debian/rules: force GnomeVFS support to be disabled. (Josselin Mouette)
  * debian/README.Debian:
    + Added a note about potential problems with packaged "old" extensions.
    + Added a note about how to manually disable packaged extensions in user
      profile.
    + Removed some old notes that don't apply anymore.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-dom-inspector.install, debian/rules: Move
    extensions files to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/ instead of
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.links: Move installed-extensions.txt symlink
    from /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/ to
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: More cleanup on removal of package.

  * Ok, I was wrong, we're still in experimental. I think we need to fix a

    make sure the hacky extensions mechanism is more bullet-proof.
  * debian/rules: --disable-installer, since we don't use it.

    - Remove returns from check_running.
    - Pull in snippets from /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions.d 
      to generate installed-extensions.txt for new extensions mechanism.  
    - An insane hack, but necessary because of upstream: Launch a Xvfb 
      to run firefox to generate the necessary extension metadata. I've
      been told this will not be necessary in the next version.
